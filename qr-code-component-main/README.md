### What I learned

This section is a recap of some of my learnings while working through this project.

- I signed up with Frontend Mentor while studying JavaScript because I hoped to better understand the connection between JS and HTML/CSS. Instead of Javascript with this first challenge I got introduced to GitHub, Discord, VS Code, Markdown and Frontend Mentor. And I haven't even gotten to the process of submitting the solution. It's a lot. This easier challenge indeed is the right place to start. 

- I learned that in the four weeks I've been studying JavaScript I already forgot a lot of HTML and CSS. This QR challenge was a good reminder that continued practice is necessary to get skilled in different coding languages.

- For example: I had forgotten that color variables don't need to be placed in *{} but instead belong in :root{}. 

- I had some trouble with resizing the image so it fit inside its box. Setting the max-width to 100% did the trick.

- I had added a top margin to the body when I realized I could easily center the whole card with {align-items: center}. 

- I was fretting over the border-radius and margins, comparing the design to my code, when I remebered reading that the purpose is not to perfectly match the design but to have a solid code. So I let it go. 


### Continued development

I just read about the Mobile-first workflow because it was mentioned in the "Built with" list. I'd never heard of it but it makes sense. I'm going to try this workflow for the next challenge.
